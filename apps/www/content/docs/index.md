description: Re-usable components for Vue inspired by shadcn/ui
group: Getting Started
---

This is a clone of the popular shadcn/ui library which helps developers build first class re-usable components. Until now there has not been any existing alternative for developers using other frameworks like Vue. This library aims to fill that gap.

Instead of supplying an opinionated set of components, this library delivers a foundation which is fully customizable to your needs.
