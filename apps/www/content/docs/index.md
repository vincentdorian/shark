description: Re-usable components for Vue inspired by shadcn/ui
group: Getting Started

This is a clone of the popular shadcn/ui library which helps developers build first class re-usable components.

Instead of supplying an opinionated set of components, this library delivers a foundation which is fully customizable to your needs.

**The UI components are written in TSX**
