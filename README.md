# sharkui

Shark UI is a port of the popular [shadcn/ui](https://github.com/shadcn/ui) component library enabling also Vue developers to use this first tier set of components. It is built using [Ark UI](https://github.com/chakra-ui/ark) as a replacement for Radix UI.

## About

In essence, the goal is to enable Vue developers to use shadcn/ui in different frameworks like Nuxt, Laravel, Vite or even Astro. This concerns the full set of features including:

- The CLI
- Theming
- All components

### Ark UI

As Radix UI is only available to React, [Ark UI](https://github.com/chakra-ui/ark) is chosen as a replacement. Ark is a project built on top of [Zag.js]() (a library to build framework-agnostic UI patterns using Finite State Machines). Both are built by the team of Chakra UI and they are planned to serve as a backbone for their component library. The patters of Ark UI are also heavily inspired by Radix and seems to be perfect fit. It still is currently in beta and will support Vue, React and Solidjs.
